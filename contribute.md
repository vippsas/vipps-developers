# Contributing

Contributing is easy. The steps below is intended to be helpful - please help us improve it.

1. Create a personal fork of the project on GitHub.
1. Clone the fork on your local machine.
1. Create a new branch to work on, use a self-explanatory name. Example: `git branch my-new-branch master`.
1. Check out your new branch (avoid working on the `master` branch): `git checkout my-new-branch`.
1. Make your change(s), implement your fix or feature(s), and comment your code.
1. Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.
1. Add or change the documentation as needed.
1. Squash your commits into a single commit with git's [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase). Create a new branch if necessary.
1. Push your branch to your fork on GitHub.
1. From your fork, in the correct branch: Open a pull request.
1. Once the pull request is approved and merged, you can pull the changes from `master` to your local repo, and delete your extra branch(es).
