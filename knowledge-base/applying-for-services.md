# Applying for services

As a merchant, you can apply to use Vipps and MobilePay payment methods in your online store or Point of Sale.

## Register as a Vipps merchant in Norway

To start a service agreement, apply for a *Merchant Agreement* on
[portal.vipps.no](https://portal.vipps.no/register).
This is a legal agreement between you and Vipps MobilePay.

Once the *Merchant Agreement* has been submitted, you can place an order for products.
This will be processed immediately once your *Merchant Agreement* is approved.

When the *Merchant Agreement* is approved and your product order is placed,
you (or the user associated with the order) will receive an email
with the name and merchant serial number of your test sales unit.
You will also receive a [test user](../test-environment.md/#test-users)
for logging into the
[Merchant Test (MT) app](../test-environment.md#test-apps), and you can start testing with the APIs.

After your order is approved, you will be granted [production API Keys](api-keys.md#production-and-test-keys)
which allow you to make API requests in the production environment.

### Requirements for becoming a Vipps merchant

You must have the following information in order to use Vipps as a payment
provider and to receive payments from Vipps users:

* A Norwegian organization number
* A Norwegian bank account
* An appointed contact person with a Norwegian phone number and Norwegian
  identity number (i.e., "fødselsnummer" or "D-nummer", 11 digits).
* Norwegian BankID

A merchant's application must be signed with Norwegian BankID.

If a foreign business is registered in the
[Brønnøysund Register](https://www.brreg.no/),
it has a contact person with a Norwegian identity number.

If a foreign business has not yet been formally established, we can
manually send the agreement for digital signing with Danish NemID,
Swedish BankID, etc. When this is required, please contact
[customer service](https://vipps.no/kontakt-oss/)
or, for partners, please contact your partner manager.

If the above is impossible, the business can use Vipps through a
[Payment Service Provider (PSP)](https://vipps.no/produkter-og-tjenester/bedrift/ta-betalt-paa-nett/ta-betalt-paa-nett/#kom-i-gang-med-vipps-pa-nett-category-2).
To use a PSP, contact the PSP.

**Please note:** If you plan to use Vipps through a PSP, please see
[Direct integration and PSP integration](direct-vs-psp.md).

We are required to perform a background check on all merchants who want to use our
services, so it might take a few days before you hear back from us.
You can check the status of your application on
[portal.vipps.no](https://portal.vipps.no).

### About Vipps users

Vipps payments can only be made by customers with a Norwegian phone number and
with a Norwegian national identity number or D-number.
This is required by the Norwegian government.

Vipps users must authenticate with Norwegian BankID when creating the Vipps account.

A D-number is given to foreign persons who do not have a Norwegian national identity number,
but have a need for identification for the Norwegian authorities.

[apply for a D-number](https://www.skatteetaten.no/en/person/foreign/norwegian-identification-number/).
