# Technical newsletter for developers 2020-04

This newsletter was sent in April 2020.

## Much faster payments on phones

Vipps eCom payments using app-switch are now done in the same biometric operation.
There is no longer a need to first log in and then confirm the payment.

This reduces the time it takes to pay with Vipps.

And: Since the "login" is connected to the payment, we have better logging and
more data, so _if_ something goes wrong, we can fix it faster.

## POS integration

Point Of Sale (POS) integrations are now possible with the eCom API.

See
[the product page](https://www.vipps.no/produkter-og-tjenester/bedrift/ta-betalt-i-butikk/vipps-i-kassa/)
and the
[Frequently Asked Questions for POS integrations](../faqs/pos-integrations-faq.md).

## eCom: skipLandingPage

If there is no way to show the Vipps landing page, it can be skipped.

This may be useful for POS integration, vending machines, etc.
See
[Skip landing page](../common-topics/vipps-landing-page.md#skip-landing-page)
for details.

## eCom: Cancel pending payments

The `/cancel` endpoint may now also be called _before_ the payment has been
reserved, meaning before the user has accepted/rejected in Vipps. This may be
useful in face-to-face situations where a customer's phone runs out of battery.

See
[Cancelling a pending order](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs/ecom-api/vipps-ecom-api#Cancelling-a-pending-order).

## User details

The user details provided by
[Vipps Hurtigkasse](https://www.vipps.no/produkter-og-tjenester/bedrift/ta-betalt-paa-nett/ta-betalt-paa-nett/)
and
[Vipps Login](https://www.vipps.no/produkter-og-tjenester/bedrift/logg-inn-med-vipps/logg-inn-med-vipps/)
will (very soon) use the same data formats.

## eCom: `/approve` endpoint for integration tests

A new
[`/approve`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs/ecom-api/vipps-ecom-api#testing)
endpoint makes it possible to approve payments through the API,
without using the app.

## New developer pages on vipps.no

We now offer nicely formatted and Vipps-branded developer pages at
<https://vipps.no/developer>.

The pages are automatically generated from the GitHub repos, so the
content is the same, and you can choose what to use.

We are just getting started, and
[feedback](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/vipps-developers/contact)
is very welcome. We know there are some (minor?) issues, please bear with us.

## API documentation in HTML format with Slate

We now offer generated HTML documentation in three formats for most APIs.
Examples for the eCom API:

* OpenAPI: <https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/api/ecom>
* ReDoc: content no longer available
* Slate: content no longer available

[Feedback](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/vipps-developers/contact)
is very welcome.

## How it works

We have made some more in-depth product information pages with screenshots:

* [eCom (_Vipps p√• Nett_)](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs/ecom-api/how-it-works/vipps-ecom-api-howitworks)
* [Recurring (_Faste Betalinger_)](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs/recurring-api/how-it-works/vipps-login-recurring-howitworks)

## Plugin overview

We now have plugins for WordPress/WooCommerce, Magento, Episerver, Shopify, Drupal:
