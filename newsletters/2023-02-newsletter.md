## Is this is the first time you receive this newsletter?

Hello! All Vipps customers that have API access now receive this technical
newsletter.

The newsletter is sent 5-10 times a year and contains important updates and
information about our APIs: https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs

Newsletter archive: https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/vipps-developers/newsletters

(You can unsubscribe if you want - see the link at the bottom)

## Report API

The Vipps Report API is now available. It is a REST API providing data about
payments in JSON format. See the
[API documentation](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs/report-api).

## Changes to the access token endpoint

Due to
[changes to the Microsoft Azure platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/768833/when-is-adal-and-azure-ad-graph-reaching-end-of-li.html)
that Vipps depends on, we have to make some minor changes to the
[`POST:/accesstoken/get`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/api/access-token#tag/Authorization-Service/operation/fetchAuthorizationTokenUsingPost)
endpoint.

We will not longer return the following fields in the response:
```
"ext_expires_in": "0",
"expires_on": "1495271273",
"not_before": "1495184574",
```

See the API specification (link above) for details.

## Reminders

### Please check your API calls for errors

We are working on eliminating incorrect API use. Please:

* Monitor the responses you get when making API calls
* Log all errors
* Fix errors as quickly as possible
* Use the
  [API Dashboard](../developer-resources/api-dashboard.md)
  to find problems with your integration.
