# New developer documentation

We have a completely new, in-progress, website for all
[developer documentation](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/):

![Vipps Developer Documentation](images/2022-09-vipps-developer-docs.png)

Examples:
* [API Guide](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs/ecom-api)
* [API Reference](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/api/ecom)
* [FAQ](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs/ecom-api/vipps-ecom-api-faq)

# Inform customers that there are no fees

It can help your conversion if you remind your users that:

* There are no Vipps fees when paying a business
* Users get all the benefits of the card when using the card in Vipps (bonus points, etc)

We recommend using this text where users select payment method:
"Husk: Vipps er alltid gebyrfritt nÃ¥r du betaler til bedrifter."

Roughly translated, this means, "Remember: Vipps is always free from fees when you pay to companies".

If you use Klarna Checkout, here are our
[tips](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-ecom-api/blob/master/vipps-ecom-api-faq.md#can-i-use-vipps-with-klarna-checkout).

# Vipps on-site messaging

[Vipps on-site-messaging](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-checkout-api/blob/main/vipps-checkout-on-site-messaging.md)
contains a badges in different variants that can be used to let your customers
know that Vipps payment is accepted.

# Partner API: Pre-fill applications

Partners can now use the
[Partner API](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-partner-api)
to pre-fill applications and
[submit a product order for a merchant](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-partner-api/blob/main/vipps-partner-api.md#submit-a-product-order-for-a-merchant).

# Settlement API

We are in the early planning phase of developing an API for
[settlements](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers/tree/master/settlements).
If you are interested in this and want to be kept up to date when we have
something to share, please send an email to integraton@vipps.no.

# Reminders

## Please check your API calls for errors

We are working on eliminating incorrect API use. Although we always respond to
incorrect API calls with a sensible HTTP status (usually `HTTP 400 Bad Request`)
and an informative error message in the response body, we see that some merchants
and partners keep making incorrect API calls.

Please:
- Monitor the responses you get when making API calls
- Log all errors
- Fix errors as quickly as possible
- Use the API Dashboard
- Contact us if there is anything we can help with

## Use the API Dashboard to find problems

The
[API Dashboard](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers#api-dashboard)
is available to all merchants for both the production and test environments,
and is an easy way to see if you are using the Vipps APIs correctly.
Think of it as a "health check", that you can use to see if there are any
problems you need to investigate.

Here's an example for the Vipps eCom API's `/refund` endpoint:
