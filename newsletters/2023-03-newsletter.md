## Is this is the first time you receive this newsletter?

Hello! All Vipps customers that have API access now receive this technical
newsletter.

The newsletter is sent 5-10 times a year and contains important updates and
information about our [APIs](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs).

See: [Newsletter archive](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/vipps-developers/newsletters).

(You can unsubscribe if you want - see the link at the bottom)

## eCom API and Express Checkout

The new express checkout flow (`"useExplicitCheckoutFlow": true`) is now the only possible
flow. Even if a merchant specifies `"useExplicitCheckoutFlow": false`,
the user will be prompted to explicitly choose a delivery address and shipping method.

This ensures that the user gets the item delivered to the right place in the right way.

See the FAQ:
[Express checkout: Old and new flow](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs/ecom-api/vipps-ecom-api-faq#express-checkout-old-and-new-flow).

## Improved shipping options in Vipps Checkout

To increase conversion, it is essential that you provide your customers their preferred shipping method.
[Vipps Checkout](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs/checkout-api)
now supports all major shipping providers in the Norwegian market, including:

* Bring/Posten
* Postnord
* Porterbuddy
* Helthjem
* Instabox

See
[How it works for shipping](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs/checkout-api/vipps-checkout-how-it-works-shipping)
for more details, and try for yourself in our
[demo store](https://demo.vipps.no/vipps-checkout-1/full).

## ePayment API

We recommend that all new integrations use the
[ePayment API](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs/epayment-api), not the
[eCom API](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs/ecom-api).

The
[ePayment API specification](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/api/epayment)
has been ready for some time, and now
we have also updated the
[API guide, FAQ, etc](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs/epayment-api).

## More Solutions

You can now see how Vipps APIs can be used and combined to give the best
user experience for vending machines, taxis, QR codes, and more.

See: [Solutions](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/vipps-solutions).

## Report API

The Vipps Report API is now available. It is a REST API providing data about
payments in JSON format. See the
[API documentation](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs/report-api).

## Reminders

### Please check your API calls for errors

We are working on eliminating incorrect API use. Please:

* Monitor the responses you get when making API calls
* Log all errors
* Fix errors as quickly as possible
* Use the
  [API Dashboard](../developer-resources/api-dashboard.md)
  to find problems with your integration.
