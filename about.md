Vipps and MobilePay have recently merged so the information is still under development. You can read about the merged new company on [vippsmobilepay.com](https://vippsmobilepay.com/#about).

Most MobilePay developer information is still found on the
[MobilePay developers website](https://developer.mobilepay.dk/), but this will be updated soon.

If you need help with MobilePay information, see [MobilePay Developer Support](https://developer.mobilepay.dk/docs/support). For help with Vipps, see [Vipps support](contact.md#vipps-support).
