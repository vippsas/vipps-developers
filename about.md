Vipps and MobilePay services have merged into one Nordic mobile wallet service, creating one of the largest mobile wallet services in Europe. This merger has brought together the expertise of several banks and individuals, and has enabled us to create an efficient and complete mobile wallet solution for our merchants and partners.

As Vipps MobilePay, we are dedicated to providing our users with an inclusive and empowering cross-border mobile wallet solution that offers the best features and functionalities of both platforms. Our goal is to ensure that these features are seamlessly rolled out across Denmark, Norway, and Finland.

For our merchants, we are focused on providing solutions within ecommerce, as well as mobile payments across borders. Our team works hard every day to create smooth experiences for both merchants and customers, optimizing the payment flow and boosting conversions.
Our mission is to create the best and most complete mobile wallet service in Europe, which means we are constantly growing and innovating to benefit our users, partners, and business customers. We are also in contact with other banks, mobile payment companies, and partners that share our ambition to make payments simple and accessible for everyone.
