Quick start guides help you get started with testing the APIs quickly.
Try one of these:

* [ePayment API](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/APIs/epayment-api/quick-start/)
* [Login API](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/APIs/login-api/vipps-login-api-quick-start)
* [Recurring API](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/APIs/recurring-api/vipps-recurring-api-quick-start)

These guides offer examples in curl and Postman.

**Please note:** Postman now only supports a cloud version. Many companies don't have permission to save keys in the cloud, as they are very secret and allow for transferring money.

If you wish to use Postman, we have created collections for most of the APIs (e.g., [ePayment](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/APIs/epayment-api/quick-start/)). These can be used to quickly run through the requests after updating a few global variables in the
[Vipps MobilePay Global Postman environment](/tools/vipps-api-global-postman-environment.json).
