# HTTP headers

Please use the following Vipps HTTP headers for all requests to the
Vipps APIs. These headers provide useful metadata about the merchant's system,
which help Vipps improve our services, and also helps in investigating problems.

These headers are **required for plugins and partners** and sent by the
[official Vipps plugins](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/vipps-plugins).
We strongly recommend that all customers with direct integration with the API to also do so.

Partners must always send the `Merchant-Serial-Number` header, and we recommend
that _everyone_ sends it, also when using the merchant's own API keys.
It can speed up any troubleshooting of API problems quite a bit.

## Example headers

For example, if the merchant's name is "Acme AS" and they offer three different systems:
point of sale (POS) integration, web shop, and vending machines,
the headers could be:

| Header| Description| Example value for POS | Example for web shop | Example for vending machine | Example for WooCommerce plugin |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------|--------|---------------|
| `Vipps-System-Name`           | The name of the solution           | `acme`    | `acme`         | `acme` | `woocommerce` |
| `Vipps-System-Version`        | The version number of the solution | `1.7`     | `2.6`          | `2.6` | `5.4` |
| `Vipps-System-Plugin-Name`    | The name of the plugin             | `acme-pos`| `acme-webshop` | `acme-vending` | `vipps-woocommerce` |
| `Vipps-System-Plugin-Version` | The version number of the plugin   | `3.2`     | `4.3`          | `4.3` | `1.4.1` |
| `Merchant-Serial-Number`      | The MSN for the sales unit                    | `123456`  | `123456`       | `123456` | `123456` |

**Important:** 
* Please use self-explanatory, human-readable and reasonably short
  values that uniquely identify the system (and plugin).
* The max length of each header is 30 characters. See the API
  specification for details.

If the `Vipps-System-Plugin-*` headers do not make sense to you,
you can simply send the same as for `Vipps-System-*`.
The important thing is that you send as much useful information as possible,
so it is as easy as possible to solve problems with your API requests if there are any.

## Idempotency

Many API requests to Vipps APIs can be retried without any side effects
by providing `Idempotency-Key`(in older APIs, this may be called, `Request-Id`)
in the header of the request.

For example, in case the request fails because of network error, it can
safely be retried with the same `Idempotency-Key` key without causing a duplicate.
The `Idempotency-Key` key must be generated by the merchant according to the API
specification.
