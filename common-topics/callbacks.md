# Callbacks

Callbacks allow Vipps to send the merchant information about the payment.
Callback are made for the following events:

* Payment successful
* Payment failed
* Payment rejected
* Payment timed out

**Please note:** Callback offer a faster user experience than polling, but you
cannot rely on callbacks alone. You must also poll
[`GET:/ecomm/v2/payments/{orderId}/details`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/api/ecom#tag/Vipps-eCom-API/operation/getPaymentDetailsUsingGET)
as described in the
[Polling guidelines](polling-guidelines.md).

**Important:**

* Vipps makes *one* attempt at a callback and cannot guarantee that it succeeds,
  as it depends on network, firewalls and other factors that Vipps cannot control.
  If the communication is broken during the process for some reason and Vipps
  is not able to execute callback to the merchant's server, the callback will
  not be retried.
* Vipps callbacks require a response within 3 seconds; otherwise, they will time out.
* Callback URLs must use HTTPS.

The callback request body is different for the different payment types:

* `"eComm Regular Payment"`: The callback contains the order and transaction details.
* `"eComm Express Payment"`: The callback contains the order and transaction details
  *and in addition* the user details and shipping details.
* If [Userinfo](userinfo.md) is used: The callback is the same as for `"eComm Express Payment"`.

See:

* [Callback examples](#callback-examples).
* [FAQ: Why do I not get callbacks from Vipps?](../frequently-asked-questions/README.md#why-do-i-not-get-callbacks-from-vipps)

## Callback URLs

The callback URLs are generated by appending the `orderId` to the `callbackPrefix`
sent in the
[`POST:/ecomm/v2/payments/{orderId}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/api/ecom#tag/Merchant-Endpoints/operation/transactionUpdateCallbackForRegularPaymentUsingPOST)
call. The `callbackPrefix` is for an API endpoint on the merchant's side.
See the [API specifications](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/api/ecom#tag/Merchant-Endpoints).

For example, if your `callbackPrefix` is `https://example.com/vipps/callback` and the
`orderId` is `acme-shop-123-order123abc`, Vipps will append `/v2/payments/acme-shop-123-order123abc`
(note the leading slash)
to `https://example.com/vipps/callback` and make a callback to
`https://example.com/vipps/callback/v2/payments/acme-shop-123-order123abc`.

Again:

* `callbackPrefix` + `/v2/payments/` + `{orderId}`
* `https://example.com/vipps/callback` + `/v2/payments/` + `acme-shop-123-order123abc`

**Important:**

* URLs must be [valid](url-validation.md).
* Vipps does *not* support sending requests to all ports, so to be safe use
  common port numbers such as: 80, 443, 8080.
* Vipps does *not* support callback URLs that return `HTTP 301 Redirect`,
  `HTTP 302 Permanently Moved` or `HTTP 307 Temporary Redirect`.
  Vipps will not follow to a `Location`.
  The callback URLs *must* be directly reachable.

## Callback examples

Below are two examples of payment update callbacks with
[`POST:[callbackPrefix]/v2/payments/{orderId}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/api/ecom#tag/Merchant-Endpoints/operation/transactionUpdateCallbackForRegularPaymentUsingPOST).

Example: `"eComm Regular Payment"` callback:

```json
{
  "merchantSerialNumber": 123456,
  "orderId": "acme-shop-123-order123abc",
  "transactionInfo": {
    "amount": 20000,
    "status": "RESERVED",
    "timeStamp": "2018-12-12T11:18:38.246Z",
    "transactionId": "5001420062"
  }
}
```

Example: `"eComm Express Payment"` callback:

```json
{
  "merchantSerialNumber": 123456,
  "orderId": "acme-shop-123-order123abc",
  "shippingDetails": {
    "address": {
      "addressLine1": "Dronning Eufemias gate 42",
      "addressLine2": "Att: Rune Garborg",
      "city": "Oslo",
      "country": "Norway",
      "postCode": "0191"
    },
    "shippingCost": 109.99,
    "shippingMethod": "By cannon"
  },
  "transactionInfo": {
    "amount": 20000,
    "status": "RESERVE",
    "timeStamp": "2018-12-12T11:18:38.246Z",
    "transactionId": "5001420062"
  },
  "userDetails": {
    "bankIdVerified": "Y",
    "dateOfBirth": "12-3-1988",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "firstName": "Ada",
    "lastName": "Lovelace",
    "mobileNumber": "12345678",
    "ssn": "12345678901",
    "userId": "1234567"
  }
}
```

**Please note:** Regular payments use `RESERVED`, but express payments use
`RESERVE`. We apologize for this, but it is technical debt and it cannot be
corrected in this version of the API, as that would break backwards compatibility.

## How to test your own callbacks

We recommend using
[HTTPie](https://httpie.io)
for testing your callbacks.

1. Create a JSON file with the callback request payload based on the example for
   [`POST:[callbackPrefix]/v2/payments/{orderId}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/api/ecom#tag/Merchant-Endpoints/operation/transactionUpdateCallbackForRegularPaymentUsingPOST):

   ```json
     {
       "merchantSerialNumber": 123456,
       "orderId": "acme-shop-123-order123abc",
       "transactionInfo": {
         "amount": 20000,
         "status": "RESERVED",
         "timeStamp": "2018-12-12T11:18:38.246Z",
         "transactionId": "5001420062"
       }
     }
   ```

   Save this JSON file as `callback.json`.
2. Build your callback URL. In this example, the `callbackPrefix` is `https://example.com/vipps/callback`,
   and the `orderId` is `acme-shop-123-order123abc`.
3. Test the callback by making a POST request to your callback URL with the JSON file as request body:

   ```http
   http POST https://example.com/vipps/callback/v2/payments/acme-shop-123-order123abc < callback.json
   ```

4. If it does not return `HTTP 200 OK`, your callback handling does not work,
   and you must correct it.

We recommend checking callbacks on the
[API Dashboard](../developer-resources/api-dashboard.md).

## Authorization for callbacks

If you provide the `authToken` when initiating a payment with
[`POST:/ecomm/v2/payments/{orderId}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/api/ecom#tag/Merchant-Endpoints/operation/transactionUpdateCallbackForRegularPaymentUsingPOST),
the `authToken` will be sent as an `Authorization` header in the callback and
shipping details requests. Please note that this is unrelated to the
[authentication](./authentication.md)
required by the Vipps API.

API spec:
[`POST:[callbackPrefix]/v2/payments/{orderId}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/api/ecom#tag/Merchant-Endpoints/operation/transactionUpdateCallbackForRegularPaymentUsingPOST)

## Vipps callback servers

The callbacks from Vipps are made from the servers described in
[Vipps request servers](../developer-resources/servers.md#vipps-request-servers).

Please make sure that requests from these servers are allowed through firewalls, etc.

## Callback statuses

These are the statuses provided by Vipps in the callbacks by
[`[callbackPrefix]/v2/payments/{orderId}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/api/ecom#tag/Merchant-Endpoints/operation/transactionUpdateCallbackForRegularPaymentUsingPOST):

| Callback type    | Response         | Description                            |
|:-----------------|:-----------------|:---------------------------------------|
| Regular checkout | `RESERVED`       | Payment reserved by user accepting the payment in Vipps. |
|                  | `SALE`           | Payment captured with direct capture by merchant (after `RESERVED`). |
|                  | `RESERVE_FAILED` | Reserve capture failed because of insufficient funds, invalid card or similar. |
|                  | `SALE_FAILED`    | Direct capture failed because of insufficient funds, invalid card or similar. |
|                  | `CANCELLED`      | Payment cancelled by the user in Vipps. |
|                  | `REJECTED`       | User did not act on the payment (timeout, etc.). |
| Express checkout | `RESERVE`        | Payment reserved by user accepting the payment in Vipps (it *is* correct that this is different from `RESERVED` for regular checkout - sorry.) |
|                  | `SALE`           | Payment captured with direct capture, by merchant (after `RESERVE`). |
|                  | `RESERVE_FAILED` | Reserve failed because of insufficient funds, invalid card or similar. |
|                  | `SALE_FAILED`    | Direct failed because of insufficient funds, invalid card or similar. |
|                  | `CANCELLED`      | Payment cancelled by user in Vipps.    |
|                  | `REJECTED`       | User did not act on the payment (timeout, etc.). |

For a full history of a payment, use
[`[callbackPrefix]/v2/payments/{orderId}/details`]( https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/api/ecom#tag/Vipps-eCom-API/operation/getPaymentDetailsUsingGET).
See [Get payment details](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-ecom-api/blob/master/vipps-ecom-api.md#get-payment-details) for more information.
