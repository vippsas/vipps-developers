The test environment is called Merchant Test (MT) and is now open for test. MT currently only allows
Norwegian phone numbers and merchants, but you can test the API and payment flow. Please see the details
of [limitations of the test environment](/docs/test-environment).

You need credentials to get access to MT. In order to receive those you just need to [sign up as partner](https://www.vippsmobilepay.com/partner/become-a-partner) and we'll e-mail you the
information you need to get started. This is also needed even though you are an existing MobilePay integrator since we need your information registered on our new joint platform.
