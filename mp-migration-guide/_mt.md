The test environment is called Merchant Test (MT) and is now open for test. MT currently only allows
Norwegian phone numbers, currency and merchants, but you can test the API and payment flow. Please see the details
of [limitations of the test environment](/docs/test-environment).

In order to request access to the test environment, please use the following links:
- [Partners](https://www.vippsmobilepay.com/partner/become-a-partner)
- [Merchants](https://vippsmobilepay.com/merchant-test-account-sign-up)

We will send you an e-mail with the information you need to get started. This is also needed even though you are an existing MobilePay integrator or merchant, since we need your information registered on our new joint platform.
