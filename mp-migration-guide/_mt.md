The test environment is called Merchant Test (MT) and is now open for test. MT currently only allows Norwegian phone numbers and merchants but you can test the API and payment flow. Please find details and limitations for MT [here](/docs/vipps-developers/test-environment).

You need credentials to get access to MT. Just request it [here](https://mobilepaygroup.com/partner/merchant-test) and weâ€™ll send you an e-mail with the information you need.
