The test environment is called Merchant Test (MT) and is now open for test. MT currently only allows
Norwegian phone numbers and merchants but you can test the API and payment flow. Please see the details
of [limitations of the test environment](/docs/vipps-developers/test-environment).

You need credentials to get access to MT. Just request it
[here](https://mobilepaygroup.com/partner/merchant-test) and weâ€™ll send you an e-mail with the
information you need.
