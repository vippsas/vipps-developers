## Vipps demo store

You can test Vipps with a _production_ version of the Vipps app
(the normal one in Apple Store and Google Play) here:
[demo.vipps.no](https://demo.vipps.no).

Maybe you want to start by scanning this QR code and go directly to
Vipps Hurtigkasse (express checkout) and buy a nice VHS cassette?

## The Vipps test environment (MT)

See
[The Vipps test environment (MT)](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers/blob/master/vipps-test-environment.md)
for more information about general test functionality,
the iOS and Android test apps, etc.

MT is short for Merchant Test.

## Postman

See our
[Postman guide](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers/blob/master/postman-guide.md)
or the
[Postman documentation](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/)
for more information about using Postman.

## API Dashboard

All merchants have access to an API Dashboard on
[portal.vipps.no](https://portal.vipps.no) under the "Utvikler" tab.

The API Dashboard shows information about your API usage, an overview of errors, etc.
Here's an example for one endpoint:

![API Dashboard](newsletters/images/2021-02-api-dashboard-example.png)

The API Dashboard is available for both the production and test environments,
and is an easy way to see if you are using the Vipps APIs correctly.
It only gives a high-level overview, so must check the actual API
responses for more details about the errors.
Think of it as a "health check" that you can use to see if there are any
problems you need to investigate.
We strongly recommend that you also monitor your Vipps integration yourself.

**Important:** Partners can ask their merchants to give them access to the
sale unit(s) the partner is making payments for, so the partner can use the
API Dashboard.

**Please note:** The API dashboard is not real-time, and events might take up to
10 minutes before they appear.

Keep in mind that the "Utvikler" tab is only available to users with admin or
developer roles.

## Vipps API servers

The test and production environments are separate and require different API credentials:

| Production (Prod) | Test (MT)        |
|-------------------|------------------|
| api.vipps.no      | apitest.vipps.no |

The servers are world accessible. Vipps only relies on the API keys, and
no requests to our servers are blocked on our side by IP addresses or similar.

The servers are the same for all APIs.

The Vipps servers all use UTC time.

**Please note:** Vipps may change the IP addresses for the API servers. To ensure
that you are whitelisting the correct IP addresses please use these hostnames
and DNS, and automatically update your firewall rules if there are DNS changes.
We can not provide the IP addresses in any other way than DNS.

## Vipps request servers

Requests made by Vipps are made from the servers specified below.
Vipps normally only uses one server at a time, and change servers approximately
every three months.

| Production (Prod)   | Disaster recovery (DR) | Test (MT)              |
|---------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| callback-1.vipps.no | callback-dr-1.vipps.no | callback-mt-1.vipps.no |
| callback-2.vipps.no | callback-dr-2.vipps.no | callback-mt-2.vipps.no |
| callback-3.vipps.no | callback-dr-3.vipps.no |                        |
| callback-4.vipps.no | callback-dr-4.vipps.no |                        |

The disaster recovery environment is as important as the production environment.

The servers are the same for all APIs.

**Please note:** Vipps may change the IP addresses for the request servers. To ensure
that you are whitelisting the correct IP addresses please use these hostnames
and DNS, and automatically update your firewall rules if there are DNS changes.
We can not provide the IP addresses in any other way than DNS.

For API products where Vipps makes requests to your servers, please make sure
that these request servers are allowed through firewalls, etc.
