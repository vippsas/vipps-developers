# Vipps settlements: OCR

<!-- START_COMMENT -->

ℹ️ Please use the website:
[Vipps MobilePay Technical Documentation](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/).

<!-- END_COMMENT -->

OCR files are no longer provided by Vipps.
Invoice payments are made directly from the user to the merchant, so settlement files
are provided by the bank, not Vipps.

Documentation for the legacy invoice solution: [Vipps Faktura](./vipps-invoice-api-vipps-faktura.pdf).
