# Settlements: OCR

OCR files are no longer provided.
Invoice payments are made directly from the user to the merchant, so settlement files
are provided by the bank, not Vipps MobilePay.

Documentation for the legacy invoice solution: [Faktura](/downloads/settlements/ocr/vipps-invoice-api-vipps-faktura.pdf).
