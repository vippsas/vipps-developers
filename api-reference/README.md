# API specification snippets

Work in progress!

This repo contains YAML snippets that can be referenced in the YAML files
for APIs.

The goal is to have a library of standard YAML snippets that can be
referenced from several APIs, and to avoid duplication.

See the API RFC for more information.

Please add more snippets using PRs:
1. Make a branch with an easy-to-understand name
2. Add what you want
3. Make a PR
4. Post on Slack and request reviews

See the API RFC for details:
