Hi

The credentials for the Vipps Developer Portal are sent automatically to the
email used in the registration. The client_secret is sent by SMS.

See the [vipps-getting-started.md](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers/blob/master/vipps-getting-started.md)
for how to log in to test and production, how to generate keys, etc.
