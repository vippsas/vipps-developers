# FAQ: Requirements



## What are the requirements for Vipps merchants?

Vipps merchants (corporate customers) must have a:

* A Norwegian organization number
* A Norwegian bank account

The merchant's Vipps application must be signed with Norwegian BankID.

Vipps must follow the regulatory requirements for KYC (Know Your Customer),
AML (Anti Money Laundering) and other risk assessment procedures.

See:
[Requirements](../apply_for_services.md#requirements).

It is also possible to use Vipps through a PSP (Payment Service Provider).
Vipps then relies on the PSP for KYC (Know Your Customer), AML (Anti Money Laundering)
and other risk assessment procedures.
To use Vipps through a PSP: Contact your PSP.

## Can I use my "Vippsnummer" in my webshop?

No.
[Vippsnummer](https://vipps.no/produkter-og-tjenester/bedrift/ta-betalt-i-butikk/ta-betalt-med-vipps/)
can't be used for
[Vipps på Nett](https://vipps.no/produkter-og-tjenester/bedrift/ta-betalt-paa-nett/ta-betalt-paa-nett/),
[Vipps Logg Inn](https://vipps.no/produkter-og-tjenester/bedrift/logg-inn-med-vipps/logg-inn-med-vipps/)
or
[Vipps Faste Betalinger (Recurring payments)](https://vipps.no/produkter-og-tjenester/bedrift/faste-betalinger/faste-betalinger/).
You need
[Vipps på Nett](https://www.vipps.no/produkter-og-tjenester/bedrift/ta-betalt-paa-nett/ta-betalt-paa-nett/).

The reason for this is that the Norwegian Tax Administration considers
"Vippsnummer" to be cash transactions,
while eCommerce is defined as remote sales (in Norwegian, *fjernhandel*). The regulations
associated with both are different enough to require this policy.
